Welcome back ghost hunters, we've got some news for you.
Halloween

Changes
Several icons have been replaced across the main menu and contract selection screens
You can no longer light objects using 'Interact' (default: Mouse 1)

Video cam no longer breaks if swapped into inventory when CCTV is on the last camera
Lighters can no longer light some candles, firelights and the campfire when not lit
Summoning circle photos will no longer take priority over other photos as often

Many performance improvements, especially in multiplayer and in the truck
Placing equipment on the wall in some areas of Sunny Meadows will no longer teleport the equipment back to the truck
Bone photos will now work more reliably
Firelight T2 now correctly lasts 5 minutes instead of 3 minutes
